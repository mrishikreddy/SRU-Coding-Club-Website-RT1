## About the Project
The SRU Coding Club Website is a dynamic platform created to connect students, host coding competitions, and provide resources—all while keeping things fast and user-friendly. Here’s what makes it special:
- **Scalability**: Handles 10,000+ users and 30,000 concurrent connections, onboarding 500+ users in its first week.
